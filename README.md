# park-control

This project is a RESTful API built with Java, Spring Boot, and MongoDB as the database. It also integrates Spring Security and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization.

The main goal of this project is to enhance my backend development skills using Java and to gain hands-on experience in building secure and scalable APIs.

I plan to refactor and improve the system over time, while continuing to study and deepen my knowledge of Java and backend development best practices.
